# MP3 PLAYER SORT

## Convert numerical .mp3 to alphabetical .mp3

### Purpose
Most mp3 players do not read .mp3 numerical files correctly, because they read files in ascending mode. 
Ascending mode is very good for list in alphabetical order, but for list in numerical order it is not good.
If we want to import songs into mp3 player by numerical file, we have problem, because the song will be sorted in the following order:
1.mp3, 10.mp3, 11.mp3, 2.mp3, 3.mp3...
To solove a problem this software will be convert files in the following order:
1.mp3 = AA.mp3,
2.mp3 = AB.mp3,
3.mp3 = AC.mp3,
etc...

### Prerequisites
- The files which we want to convert must be .mp3 format
- The files must be lined up from the smallest to the largest by incremental order. Example 1.mp3, 2.mp3, ... n.mp3
- Run the software by OS Microsoft Windows

### Usage
 - Put MP3_Sort.exe in directory where they are located .mp3 files which need to be converted
 - Run MP3_Sort.exe
 - After running MP3_Sort.exe it will open command prompt window where the reports will be printed
